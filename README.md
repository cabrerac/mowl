# MOWL: A Domain Specific Language for Handling Modular Ontologies 

MOWL is a domain specific language for handling modular ontologies based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE). This language enables the manipulation of multiple ontologies, which can be connected through e-connections<sup>1</sup>. MOWL extends the Ontology Web Language (OWL<sup>2</sup>) with concepts to connect two or more ontologies allowing a modular development and management of knowledge models. Such models can be translated to knowledge bases implemented on Jess<sup>3</sup> to support knowledge-based applications.

MOWL is developed using the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF). So as a first requirement you must download and install eclipse from the [EMF web site.](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)

Different artifacts compose MOWL as follows:

* mowl.installer is the update-site that can be used to install the MOWL editor in eclipse.
* mowl.metamodel contains the Ecore metamodels that define the MOWL<sup> 4</sup> and JESS languages.
* mowl.edit contains code generated by Eclipse to create MOWL models. 
* mowl.editor contains code generated by Eclipse to create a tree-based editor of MOWL models. 
* mowl.mtc.design contains the transformation chain that translates a model conform to the MOWL language to a knowledge base written in JESS.
* mowl.tool.design contains the implementation of the graphic editor using [SIRIUS](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/).

Users can explore these artifacts according to their interests as follows:

* Have a look to the mowl.installer instructions, if you want to use the graphic editor to create Multiontologies.
* Have a look to the mowl.installer and mowl.mtc.design instructions, if you want to use the graphic editor to create Multiontologies and generate their knowledge bases.
* Have a look to the mowl.metamodel and mowl.tool.design instructions, if you want to extend MOWL. This might also need to modify the transformations in mowl.mtc.design.
